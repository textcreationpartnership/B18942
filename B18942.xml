            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S His Majesty was and is very desirous to receive any Reason from both Houses, or their Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, which might induce His Majesty to give other Answers, if what He hath or shall give doe not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy, so He rather expected those reasons should have had their foundation in the Law of the Land, and have shewed Him that by Law He had not the Right He pretended, or that by that, or by some fundamentall Law, they had a Right superior to His in what was now in Question, Or have shewed Him some Legall Reason why the Persons trusted by Him were uncapable of that Trust, then only have insisted upon Feares and Iealousies, of which as Hee knowes not the ground, so He is ignorant of the Cure. But this His Majesty knowes, that if readinesse to acknowledge, retract and provide against for the future any thing of error that had hapned against Law, and having actually pass'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204607:12"/> more important Bills, and parted with more of His known Rights for the satisfaction of His Subjects, then not only any one but all His Predecessors, would have been thought a sufficient Remedy for Fears and Iealousies, the Kingdom might still have enjoyed a safe, firme and lasting Peace, and those would not first have been made a Reason to seaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Rights, and then after have been made an Argument to perswade Him to part with them. And His Majesty won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Committee should not see, that this Argument might extend to the depriving Him of, or at least sharing with Him in, all His just Rigall Power (since Power as well as Forces may be the object of Feares and Iealousies, and there will be alwaies a Power left to hurt, whilest there is any left to protect and defend;) And that if those Rights which He received from His Predecessors were really so formidable, That would have been more fear'd before, which is now feard so much, and His Forts and Castles would either not have been attempted, or at least have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Him to defend and keep them, and have kept this from being a Question now between them. Which since they could not doe, His Majesty (if He had as much inclination, as He hath more Right, to Feares and Iealousies) might have more reason to insist upon some Addition of Power, as a Security to enable Him to keep His Forts, when He hath them, then they to make any Difficulty to restore them to Him in the same condition they were before. But as His Majesty contents Himselfe with, so, He takes God to witnesse, His greatest desire is alwaies to observe and main- the Law of the Land, and expects the same from His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and believes the mutuall observance of that Rule, and neither of them to feare what the Law fears not, to be on both parts a better Cure for that dangerous Disease of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204607:13"/> Fears and Iealousies, and a better means to establish a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a perpetuall Peace, then for His Majesty to devest Himselfe of those Trusts which the Law of the Land hath setled in the Crowne alone, to preserve the Power and Dignity of the Prince, for the better Protection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and of the Law, and to avoyd those dangerous Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which the interest of any Sharers with Him would have infallibly produced.</p>

And that Your Majesties Answer layes some Taxe upon the Parliament, as if defective, and thereby uncapable of making such a provisionall Law for an Oath.

And if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of both Houses in their Reasons had not necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted His Majesty in His own Defence, to give such Answers as could not upon those poynts deliver Truth without some shew of sharpnesse, no expression of that kind in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Answer had given any pretence for the Rejection of, or refusing so much as to Treat upon the Cessation; Which (though it were at present for no long time, yet) was from the day named by themselves the 25. of <hi>March.</hi> Whereas His Majesty first mov'd for a Cessation and Treaty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Limitation at all in the time of either; and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was most ready to have enlarged the time (so that in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204607:20"/> the mean while the poynt of Quarters might be so setled, as that His Armies might subsist,) and which might have been (if they had pleas'd) a very good and promising earnest and Forerunner of that great Blessing of Peace; for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which the wishes and endeavours of all good men being earnestly bent, a farther debate in order to so great a benefit did not deserve to be stiled a Consumption of time. And His Majesty cannot but conceive Himselfe to be in a strange Condition, if the doubtfulnesse of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, (which must alwayes be, whilest the Treaty is at such a distance, and power is denyed to those upon the place to help to clear and explaine) or His necessary Replying to Charges laid upon Him, (that He might not seem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what was so charged) or the Limitation of the time of seven dayes for the Treaty (which was not limited by his Majesty, who ever desired to have avoyded that and other Limitations, which have given great interruptions to it) should be as well believed to be the Grounds, as they are made the Arguments of the Rejection of that, which (next to Peace it selfe) His Majesty above all things most desires to see agreed and setled, and which His Majesty hopes (if it may be yet agreed on) will give His People such a Tast of such a Blessing, that after a short time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and comparing of their severall Conditions in Warre and Peace, and what should move them to suffer so much by a Change, they will not think those their Friends that shall force them to it, or be themselves ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the renewing of their former miseries, without some greater evidence of Necessity then can appeare to them, when they shall have seen (as they shall see, if this Treaty be suffered to proceed) that His Majesty neither askes nor denies any thing, but what not only according to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204607:21"/> Law He may, but what in Honour and Care of His People He is obliged to ask or deny. And this alone (which a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short Cessation would produce) His Majesty esteemes a very considerable Advantage to the Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but presse againe and againe, that whatever is thought doubtfull in the Expressions of the Articles, may (as in an Houre it may well be done) be expounded, and whatsoever is excepted at may be debated and concluded, and that Power and Instructions may be given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to that end, that the miserable effects of Warre, the effusion of English blood, and desolation of England (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they can be totally taken away) may by this means be stayed and interrupted.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty supposes, that when the Committee was last required to desire His Majesty to give a speedy and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Answer to the first Proposition concerning disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, His answers in that poynt (to which no reply hath been made, and which He hopes by this time have given satisfaction) were not transmitted and received, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Houses should presse His Majesty for a speedy and positive Answer to the first part of their first Proposition concerning disbanding, when to the second part of the very same Proposition, concerning His Returne to both Houses of Parliament, they had not given any Power or instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Committee, so much as to Treat with His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; And when His Majesty (if His desire of Peace and of speeding the Treaty in order to that had not been preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with Him) might with all manner of Iustice have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed to begin to Treat upon one part, untill they had been inabled to Treat upon the other; In which poynt, and for want of which Power from them, the only stop now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, His Majesties Answers to both parts of their first
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204607:21"/> Proposition, being given in, transmitted, and yet remaining unanswered. To which, untill the Houses shall be at leasure to make answer, that as little delay in this Treaty, as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may be caus'd by it, His Majesty desires likewise, That the Committee may be enabled to Treat upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propositions in their severall orders.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O show to the whole World how earnestly His Majesty longs for Peace, and that no successe shall make Him desire the continuance of His Army to any other end, or for any longer time then That, and untill things may be so setled, as that the Law may have a full, free, and uninterrupted course, for the defence and preservation of the Rights of His Majesty, both Houses, and His good Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:204607:25"/>1. As soon as His Majesty is satisfied in His first Proposition concerning His own Revenue, Magazines, Ships, and Forts, in which He desires nothing but that the just, known, Legall Rights of His Majestie (devolved to Him from His Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) and of the Persons trusted by Him, which have violently been taken from both, be restored unto Him and unto them, unlesse any Just and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall exceptions against any of the Persons trusted by Him (which are yet unknown to His Majestie) can be made appeare to Him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As soon as all the Members of both Houses shall be restored to the same Capacity of Sitting and Voting in Parliament, as they had upon the first of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1641. the same of right belonging unto them by their Birth-Rights, and the free Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those that sent them, and having been Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them for adhering to His Majestie in these distractions. His Majestie not intending that this should extend either to the Bishops, whose Votes have been taken away by Bill, or to such in whose places upon new Writs new elections have been made.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As soon as His Majesty and both Houses may be secured from such tumultuous Assemblies, as, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:204607:25"/> the great breach of the Priviledges, and the high dishonour of Parliaments, have formerly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about both Houses, and awed the members of the same, and occasioned two severall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from the Lords House, and two severall desires of that House to the House of Commons, to joyne in a Declaration against them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with which desire, might have prevented all these miserable distractions, which have ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which security His Majesty conceives can be only setled by adjourning the Parliament to some other place, at the least twenty miles from <hi>London,</hi> the choice of which His Majesty leaves to both Houses.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty will most cheerfully and readily consent that both Armies be immediatly disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and give a present meeting to both His Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament at the time and place at and to which the Parliament shall be agreed to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty being most confident, that the Law will then recover the due credit and estimation, and that upon a free debate in a full and peaceable convention of <hi>Parliament,</hi> such provisions will be made against seditious Preaching and Printing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204607:26"/> against His Majesty, and the established Lawes, which hath been one of the chief causes of the present distractions; and such care will be taken concerning the Legall and known Rights of His Majesty, and the Property and Liberty of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that whatsoever hath been published or done in or by Colour of any illegall Declaration, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Order of one or both Houses, or any Committee of either of them, and particularly the power to raise Armes without His Majesties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, will be in such manner recalled, disclaimed and provided against, that no seed will remaine for the like to spring out of for the future, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe the peace of the Kingdom, and to endanger the very being of it.</p>
                  <p>And in such a Convention His Majesty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by His readinesse to consent to whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be proposed to Him by Bill for the Reall good of His Subjects, (and particularly for the better discovery and speedier Conviction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants, for the Education of the Children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists by Protestants in the Protestant Religion, for the preuention of practices of Papists against the State, and the due execution of the Lawes, and true levying of the penalties against them) to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204607:26"/> make knowne to all the World, how causelesse those Feares and Jealousies have been which have been raised against Him, and by that so distracted this miserable Kingdom. And if this offer of His Majesty be not consented to, (in which He askes nothing for which there is not apparent Iustice on His side, and in which He deferres many things highly concerning both Himselfe and People, till a full and peaceable convention of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which in Justice He might now require) His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is confident, that it will then appeare to all the World, not only who is most desirous of Peace, and whose fault it is that both Armies are not now disbanded, but who have been the true and first cause that this Peace was ever interrupted, or these Armies raised; and the beginning or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Warre, and the destruction &amp; deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this poor Kingdom (which is too likely to ensue) will not, by the most interessed, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or prejudicate Person, be imputed to His Majesty.</p>
